I am currently a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in the Department of Computer Science, the School of Natural and Computing Sciences, University of Aberdeen, UK. Before this, I received a PhD degree in Robotics & Artificial Intelligence from the Dyson School of Design Engineering at Imperial College London in 2023, working in the Morph Lab with Prof.Thrishantha Nanayakkara and Prof.Peter Childs FREng.

Before I joined the University of Aberdeen, I worked as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Imperial College London, working with Prof. Ravi Vaidyanathan in the Biomechatronics Lab.

The aim of our research group is to develop a hybrid intelligent robotics and  wearable device system that can interact with the physical world safely and robustly. We hope to prototype novel AI-enabled healthcare robotics systems for teaching, education, collaboration and ultimately, commercialization. My research interests include:
* Conducting fundamental research to develop soft, wearable, and implantable bioelectronic sensors, e-skins, and soft robotics
* Developing advanced neuromorphic computation bioelectronic systems for robotic AI-enabled Healthcare
* Embedded AI and robotics perception and navigation in human-centric digital healthcare

I currently have funding to accept PhD applications, please feel free to reach out for discussions.
