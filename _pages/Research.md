The global rapid rise in ageing populations, coupled with the challenges of the pandemic and a shortage of medical instruments, has highlighted the urgent need for advanced bioelectronic devices that support decentralized and personalized healthcare.  
These devices include wearable healthcare technologies, minimally invasive biosensors, human implantable electrodes, closed-loop smart sensing systems, and brain-inspired soft hardware. 
To strengthen its global leadership and ensure continued competitiveness in biomechatronics, the aim of our research group is to develop a hybrid intelligent robotics and  wearable device system that can interact with the physical world safely and robustly. We hope to prototype novel AI-enabled healthcare robotics systems for teaching, education, collaboration and ultimately, commercialization.
